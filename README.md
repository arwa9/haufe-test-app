# Notes
- You will see that the main page is not directly the "Characters List" view. I wanted to make a home page with a button that takes you there so I could create a Characters Module which is lazy-loaded but with preloading so it's being load in the background. This way. I think it's all better organised and also more efficient (even though it's a really small application and the impact is minimal).
- I set up .scss in the project with some partial stylesheets.
- I did not add tests because, even though I have some knowledge about how they work and how to do them, I am not as skillfull writing tests as I am in developing the frontend in general. So, I thought that, since I didn't have much time, I would better be honest and not try to do something that would be so-so and take more time to work on other features.
- I added some humorous touches here and there, so I hope you also smile a bit while doing the review! :)
